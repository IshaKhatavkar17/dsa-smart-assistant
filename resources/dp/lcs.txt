KEY: LCS
CATEGORY: Dynamic Programming
DIFFICULTY: Medium
TIME_COMPLEXITY: O(m*n)
SPACE_COMPLEXITY: O(m*n)

DESCRIPTION:
Longest Common Subsequence finds the longest sequence of elements common to both strings
without requiring them to be consecutive. Foundation for many string problems.

WHEN_TO_USE:
- String comparison / similarity
- Edit distance calculations
- Diff algorithms
- Common pattern finding
- Merge operations

JAVA_TEMPLATE:
```java
class Solution {
    public static int lcs(String s1, String s2) {
        int m = s1.length(), n = s2.length();
        int[][] dp = new int[m + 1][n + 1];
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
                if (s1.charAt(i - 1) == s2.charAt(j - 1)) {
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1;
                } else {
                    dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]);
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[m][n];
    }
}
```

EXAMPLE_PROBLEMS:
- Longest Common Subsequence
- Edit Distance
- Delete Operation for Two Strings
- Minimum ASCII Delete Sum for Two Strings
- Distinct Subsequences
