KEY: DUTCH_NATIONAL_FLAG
ALIASES: Three-Way Partition, Color Sort, Three-Pointer Technique
CATEGORY: Array String Advanced
DIFFICULTY: Medium

WHEN_TO_USE:
- "Sort array with only 3 distinct values"
- "Partition array into three groups"
- "One pass sorting required"
- Problem has exactly 3 types of elements (0s, 1s, 2s)

INTUITION:
Imagine organizing Dutch flags: Red, White, Blue.
Use three pointers: left (for reds), middle (for traversal), right (for blues).
Move middle pointer, swapping to keep invariant:
- All 0s to the left of low
- All 1s in the middle
- All 2s to the right of high

JAVA_TEMPLATE:
```java
class Solution {
    public void sortColors(int[] nums) {
        int low = 0, mid = 0, high = nums.length - 1;
        
        while (mid <= high) {
            if (nums[mid] == 0) {
                swap(nums, low, mid);
                low++;
                mid++;
            } else if (nums[mid] == 1) {
                mid++;
            } else { // nums[mid] == 2
                swap(nums, mid, high);
                high--;
            }
        }
    }
    
    private void swap(int[] nums, int i, int j) {
        int temp = nums[i];
        nums[i] = nums[j];
        nums[j] = temp;
    }
}
```

TIME_COMPLEXITY: O(n)
SPACE_COMPLEXITY: O(1)

COMMON_MISTAKES:
- Not maintaining loop invariant
- Incrementing mid when swapping with high (breaks logic)
- Using extra space (HashMap/counts)
- Off-by-one errors with pointers
- Swapping mid twice unnecessarily
